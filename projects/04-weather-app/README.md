# Project 04 – Weather Dashboard

## Learning Objectives
- Working with real-world APIs (OpenWeatherMap API)
- Geolocation API usage
- Data transformation and formatting
- Conditional rendering based on data
- Advanced CSS layouts and animations

## Requirements
- Fetch current weather data based on user location or search
- Display temperature, conditions, humidity, wind speed
- Show 5-day forecast
- Geolocation support (with permission)
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Unit conversion (Celsius/Fahrenheit)

## Technical Constraints
- Use OpenWeatherMap API (free tier available with API key)
- No external frameworks or libraries
- Vanilla JavaScript for API calls and DOM manipulation
- Semantic HTML
- CSS variables for consistent theming
- Proper error handling for API and geolocation

## API Setup
1. Sign up at https://openweathermap.org/api for a free API key
2. Use Current Weather Data API and 5 Day / 3 Hour Forecast API
3. Implement proper error handling for API limits

## Stretch Goals
- Add weather map visualization
- Save favorite locations
- Weather alerts/notifications
- Detailed weather charts
- Integration with multiple weather services

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up HTML structure for weather display
2. Get API key from OpenWeatherMap
3. Implement geolocation functionality
4. Create functions to fetch current weather and forecast
5. Format and display weather data attractively
6. Add search functionality for different locations
7. Implement unit conversion
8. Add advanced features (stretch goals)

## Usage
Open `index.html` in your browser. You may need to serve over HTTP (not file://) for geolocation to work properly.

## Learning Connections
This project reinforces concepts from:
- FreeCodeCamp: Back End Development and APIs
- Scrimba: JavaScript Course (API integration)
- Boot.dev: Backend Development (API consumption)
