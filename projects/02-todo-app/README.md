# Project 02 – Interactive Todo Application

## Learning Objectives
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Local storage for data persistence
- Form handling and validation
- Component-based thinking in vanilla JavaScript

## Requirements
- Add, edit, and delete todo items
- Mark items as complete/incomplete
- Filter todos (all, active, completed)
- Persist todos to localStorage
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Technical Constraints
- No external frameworks or libraries
- Vanilla JavaScript only
- Semantic HTML
- Accessible markup with proper ARIA attributes
- CSS variables for consistent theming

## Stretch Goals
- Add due dates to todos
- Priority levels (high, medium, low)
- Categories or tags for organization
- Export/Import functionality
- Dark/light mode toggle

## Implementation Steps
1. Plan the HTML structure with semantic elements
2. Style the base layout with CSS
3. Implement core functionality (add, delete, toggle)
4. Add filtering capabilities
5. Implement localStorage persistence
6. Add advanced features (stretch goals)

## Usage
Open `index.html` in your browser. The application should work without a server.

## Learning Connections
This project reinforces concepts from:
- FreeCodeCamp: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
- Scrimba: JavaScript Course
- Boot.dev: Basic backend concepts (data persistence)
