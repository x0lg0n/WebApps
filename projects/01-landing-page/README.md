# Project 01 – Static Landing Page

Objectives:
- Build a semantic page with header, hero, features, and footer.
- Apply responsive layout using Flexbox or Grid.
- Add a simple color theme and clean typography.

Requirements:
- Works on mobile and desktop.
- No external frameworks; keep it vanilla.
- Keep CSS maintainable with variables and simple utility classes.

Stretch Ideas:
- Add a responsive navigation toggle.
- Include a feature grid with cards.
- Add a call-to-action button with subtle hover states.

Usage:
Open `index.html` in your browser and iterate. Link `styles.css` and `script.js` for styling and interactions.
