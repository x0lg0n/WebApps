# Setting Up Your Learning Environment

Follow these steps to get your development environment ready for web development learning.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install Node.js and npm**
   - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Choose the LTS version for stability
   - This includes npm (Node Package Manager)

2. **Install a Code Editor**
   - Recommended: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - Extensions to install:
     - Live Server (for local development)
     - Prettier (for code formatting)
     - GitLens (for version control)

3. **Install Git**
   - Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
   - Use default settings during installation

## Initial Setup

1. **Clone or Download this Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WebApps.git
   cd WebApps
   ```

2. **Install Development Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start a local server with live reload functionality.

## Alternative: Simple Setup (No Build Tools)

If you prefer a simpler approach without Node.js:

1. Open any HTML file directly in your browser
2. Use the browser's developer tools for debugging
3. Make changes and refresh the browser to see updates
