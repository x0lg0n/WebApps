# Contributing Guide

Principles:

- Keep examples minimal, focused, and runnable.
- Prefer vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and small steps.
- Avoid copying paid or copyrighted course content.

Structure:

- Place small examples in `foundations/`.
- Place guided builds in `projects/` with a short README.
- Add links in `resources/` and logs in `journals/`.

Style:

- Use semantic HTML and accessible patterns.
- Use CSS variables; keep selectors simple.
- Keep JS modular and avoid global state when possible.

Pull Requests:

- Describe what you learned and what changed.
- Include quick usage notes (how to open/run).
- Keep diffs tight; avoid unrelated reformatting.
