# HTML Foundations

Goals:
- Practice semantic elements (headings, sections, navigation).
- Build accessible structure (labels, alt text, landmarks).
- Understand document flow and inline vs block elements.

Platform Alignment:
- FreeCodeCamp: Responsive Web Design Certification
- Scrimba: HTML Fundamentals
- Boot.dev: HTML basics for web development

Try:
- Create a simple article layout with a header, main, and footer.
- Add a nav with links that jump to sections.
- Use meaningful headings (h1 → h2 → h3).
- Practice accessibility with proper alt text and labels.
- Experiment with different input types and form validation.

Open `index.html` in your browser and iterate.
