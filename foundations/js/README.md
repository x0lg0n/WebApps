# JavaScript Foundations

Goals:
- Manipulate the DOM and handle events.
- Work with data: arrays, objects, fetch.
- Structure code with modules and functions.
- Understand asynchronous programming and error handling.

Platform Alignment:
- FreeCodeCamp: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
- Scrimba: JavaScript Course and Advanced JavaScript
- Boot.dev: JavaScript fundamentals for backend development

Try:
- Append an element to the page on load (`script.js`).
- Add a button that updates text when clicked.
- Implement form validation with JavaScript.
- Practice array methods (map, filter, reduce).
- Create a simple API call with fetch.
- Handle errors with try/catch blocks.
