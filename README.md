# WebApps – Practical Web Development Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository is your structured playground for learning practical web development and a clean reference others can follow. It organizes hands-on foundations, mini projects, journaling, and curated resources while staying lightweight and beginner-friendly.

## What You’ll Learn

- HTML: semantic structure, accessible patterns
- CSS: layout, responsive design, theming, animations
- JavaScript: DOM, events, data fetching, modules
- Frontend Frameworks: React, Vue, or Angular
- Backend Development: Node.js, databases, APIs
- Practical Projects: from static pages to full-stack applications

## Repo Structure

- `foundations/` – small, focused examples for HTML, CSS, and JS
- `projects/` – guided mini-projects with objectives and stretch ideas
- `journals/` – templates to track your daily progress and notes
- `resources/` – links and references (FreeCodeCamp, Scrimba, Boot.dev, docs)
- `.editorconfig` & `.gitignore` – consistent formatting and tidy repo hygiene

## Learning Paths by Platform

## How to Use

1. Start in `foundations/` to warm up with bite-sized examples.
2. Build in `projects/` following the learning paths above.
3. Log your learnings in `journals/` using `template.md`.
4. Explore `resources/links.md` for curated learning paths.
5. Share improvements via PRs following `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Running Examples

All examples are static and can be opened directly in your browser: open `index.html` in any project folder.

For live reload during development:
- Install Node.js and npm
- Run `npm install -g live-server` (or `npx live-server`)
- Navigate to project directory and run `live-server`

## Contributing

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for style and pull request guidelines. Keep examples minimal, focused, and runnable.
