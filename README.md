# WebApps – Practical Web Development Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository is your structured playground for learning practical web development and a clean reference others can follow. It organizes hands-on foundations, mini projects, journaling, and curated resources while staying lightweight and beginner-friendly.

## What You’ll Learn
- HTML: semantic structure, accessible patterns
- CSS: layout, responsive design, theming, animations
- JavaScript: DOM, events, data fetching, modules
- Practical Projects: from static pages to interactive apps

## Repo Structure
- `foundations/` – small, focused examples for HTML, CSS, and JS
- `projects/` – guided mini-projects with objectives and stretch ideas
- `journals/` – templates to track your daily progress and notes
- `resources/` – links and references (FreeCodeCamp, Scrimba, Boot.dev, docs)
- `.editorconfig` & `.gitignore` – consistent formatting and tidy repo hygiene

## How to Use
1. Start in `foundations/` to warm up with bite-sized examples.
2. Build in `projects/` starting with `01-landing-page`.
3. Log your learnings in `journals/` using `template.md`.
4. Explore `resources/links.md` for curated learning paths.
5. Share improvements via PRs following `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Suggested Learning Path
1. Foundations: HTML → CSS → JS basics
2. Projects:
	- 01: Static Landing Page (structure + responsive styles)
	- 02: Todo App (DOM, events, state)
	- 03: API Fetcher (fetch, promises, error handling)

You can adapt the order to match lessons from FreeCodeCamp, Scrimba, or Boot.dev.

## Running Examples
All examples are static and can be opened directly in your browser: open `index.html` in any project folder.

Optional dev server: we can add simple scripts (e.g., `vite` or `live-server`) if you want hot reload. See the repository issues for setup or ask in chat to enable it.

## Contributing
See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for style and pull request guidelines. Keep examples minimal, focused, and runnable.

## Credits
This repo does not copy course content; it references public docs and your personal notes. Please respect platform terms of use.
